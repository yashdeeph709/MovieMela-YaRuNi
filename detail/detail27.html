The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a 2015 American 3D animated/live action comedy film based on the Nickelodeon television series SpongeBob SquarePants. A sequel to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), it was directed by Paul Tibbitt, and stars the regular television cast (Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence), who returned to reprise their respective roles from the series and the previous film and Antonio Banderas.[4] Matt Berry co-stars as Bubbles. The plot follows Burger-Beard the Pirate who steals the Krabby Patty secret formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, and Plankton must travel to the surface and confront Burger-Beard in order to get the formula back.
